    "# EEE466 Lab 2\n",
    "OCdt Wooltorton, OCdt Murray, Submitted 2 Oct 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "In a perfect world, a network would function perfectly, and all data on that\n",
    "network would reliably make it to its final destination. Unfortunately, problems\n",
    "occur frequently which cause data to arrive late, inconsistently, or not at all.\n",
    "To fix this, protocols must be implemented to ensure reliable data transmission.\n",
    "In this lab, we designed a reliable file transfer protocol which used UDP as a \n",
    "transport layer protocol which could handle packet drops, packet lag, and\n",
    "duplicate packet sends. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Choices:\n",
    "Notable design choices include:\n",
    "Designing the protocol around reliably transferring one packet at a time. \n",
    "This was implemented because it was more memory-friendly than the alternative \n",
    "method we came up with. The alternative involved storing packets in a bank\n",
    "which, if a packet did not come in, the sender could back-track to the last \n",
    "message it knew it received. The flaw in this message, however, is depending on\n",
    "the resources the computer has and the quality of the network, the bank may eat \n",
    "up all the memory of the computer. The method we implemented typically means\n",
    "slower data transfer if network quality is bad, but more sends/receives will not\n",
    "be taxing on the sender/receiver's resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of responsibilities between the send file and send message. This \n",
    "design choice also was applied to the receive file/message. Because the FTP \n",
    "relies on reliably sending one packet before the next gets sent, all of the \n",
    "reliability functionality was implemented in the send/receive message. The \n",
    "responsibilities of the send/receive file methods were limited to anything file\n",
    "related: send_file had to initiate a file send and pass information from the\n",
    "file to the send_message method. receive_file had to write received data to a \n",
    "filepath, and detect when the end of the file was sent. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Describe how you implemented an application level protocol to handle \n",
    "reliability and command and data messages. Include a sequence diagram in your \n",
    "submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main overarching concept we attempted to implement in this lab was to\n",
    "make reliability a responsibility of each individual message. This meant that\n",
    "when a message was sent, errors would be detected and solutions would be \n",
    "implemented as quickly as possible. The main difference between sending \n",
    "command messages and data messages was the encoding of the information within.\n",
    "Commands were passed as strings, and data was read as bytes from the files. \n",
    "In this case a new parameter, \"data\", was included in the send_message function\n",
    "so that the client/server applications would not need to be changed and sending\n",
    "bytes could be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence disagram in included in this submission which outlines a GET \n",
    "request made from the client to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Describe how your solution implements *tiering* and *layered* architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of layering is the logical separation of code to produce a \n",
    "coherent, but separated, set of funcitonality. A great example of layering in\n",
    "this application is the logical separation of the send_file and send_message\n",
    "methods. They each have their own functionality, which means the other can be \n",
    "changed, and as long as the inputs/outputs remain the same, they will still work\n",
    "together. The concept of Tiering is the physical archetecture of the system that\n",
    "is being created. In this case, there are two tiers: the client and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. How does the parameter 'b' (bytes) change the way Python performs `read()` \n",
    "and `write()` actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter \"b\" changes the way Python performs read and write actions by\n",
    "reading the raw data from a file rather than enoding it. This is important\n",
    "because some files cannot be encoded the same as other files. For example, in\n",
    "this lab we had to read .jpg files, which could not be encoded in the utf-8 \n",
    "encoding which worked so well for .txt files. "
